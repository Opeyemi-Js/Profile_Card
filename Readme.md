## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During the coding process of this project i gain some css tricks, learnt about the use of pseduo classes.

```css
  .wrapper::before{
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    height: 25%;
    width: 100%;
    background-image: url(./images/bg-pattern-card.svg);
    border-radius: 10px 10px 0 0;
  }
```
### Continued development
I need to improve on this areas(flexbox, the use of pseudo element/class)

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.codinglabweb.com) - This helped me for the coverpage design. I really liked his approach on how he code the cover background using the ::before pseudo element.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.github.com/Modu-kunjo/Profile-card) - This is an amazing github account which helped me easily understand how to set positions to background image and also set multiple background.
